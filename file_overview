		Makefile: left litex
		artix-7.h: left litex
		ibex_appinit.c: left litex
		ibex_boot.c: left litex; should ibex_boardinitialize stay empty?
		ibex_bringup.c: left litex; how does file sysyem mounting work?

arch:
	Kconfig: included ibex board artix-7
	include/
		chip.h: left litex empty
		irq.h: only declare listed interrupts and exceptions (in ibex docs); what to do with external interrupts?

			!deleted: ibex_clint.h: left litex; how does clint (core local interrupt) work?
			ibex_memorymap.h: modified uart_base; what to do with cputimer and timer base?
			!deleted: ibex_plic.h: left litex; probably necessary to remove csr definitions; how does plic (platform level interrupt controller) work?
			ibex_uart.h: modified offsets, taken from example project
		Kconfig: left litex; uart config ok like this?
		Make.defs: left litex
		chip.h: left litex empty
		ibex.h: left litex empty
		ibex_allocateheap.c: left litex; why riscv_addregion empty?
		ibex_clockconfig.c: left litex; are these two functions necessary (probably used by riscv code)?
		ibex_clockconfig.h: see line above
		ibex_config.h: deleted second uart
		ibex_head.S: left litex; how does g_instackalloc and g_intstack work?
		ibex_idle.c: left litex; does WFI work?
		ibex_irq.c: what does colorize stack do?; enable and disable irq: only one command enough?; other functions: necessary?, what to do with up_irq_enable?
		ibex_irq_dispatch.c: modified calculation of irq of mcause; what to do with external interrupts? why adjust mepc? how does g_current_regs work?
		ibex_lowputc.c: busy waiting -> better solution with interrupts? lowsetup left empty, necessary?
		ibex_lowputc.h: left litex, just cplusplus code
		ibex_memorymap.h: idlestack constants defined here; left litex
		ibex_serial.c: left litex; a lot of empty functions -> what can be eliminated?
		ibex_start.c: left litex; could probably made to fit ibex better; how to clear .bss?
		ibex_timerisr.c: interrupt_flags hardcoded, where to set constants?
		ibex_vectors.S: left litex; same concept as in example project


--Notes:
-Tracer useful for debugging?
